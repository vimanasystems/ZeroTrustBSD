### 📡 Tactical SDR & 5G Radio Hardware

| Use Case                     | Recommended Hardware               | Notes |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| **Private LTE/5G**           | LimeSDR, USRP B210/B205, srsRAN    | Supports OpenRAN, deployable with VXLAN and pf |
| **Mesh Comms & Tactical Edge**| HackRF One, XTRX, TARPN, Airspy    | Ideal for field nodes with Zero Trust firewalling |
| **Signal Intelligence & Monitoring** | RTL-SDR, KerberosSDR             | For RF anomaly detection or spectrum visibility |
| **Edge Gateway**             | x86 rugged fanless with SDR USB    | Supports offline or satellite fallback links |

---

### 📶 MPLS-Ready Networking Hardware

| Requirement                  | Hardware Type                      | OpenBSD Status |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| **MPLS Switching**           | Intel NICs with SR-IOV, Juniper, MikroTik CCR | MPLS tagging supported via `mpls(4)` |
| **High Throughput**          | Dual/Quad-port Intel 82599/710     | Recommended for 10/40G OpenBSD deployments |
| **BGP/MPLS Integration**     | FRRouting VM, OpenBGPD             | Use OpenBGPD with VMM for control plane isolation |

### 🛰️ Satellite Link Integration

| Feature                      | Recommendation                     | Why It Works |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Out-of-Band Management**   | Iridium Edge, RockBLOCK 9603       | Serial-over-Sat for low-speed fallback |
| **High-Bandwidth SatCom**    | Viasat, Starlink w/ custom CPE     | Use pf anchors to throttle and secure SatCom |
| **Field Redundancy**         | LTE failover via USB modem + sat   | ZeroTrustBSD handles routing and link health failover |
