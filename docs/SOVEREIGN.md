# 🇪🇺 Sovereign Architecture Strategy: EuroShield Stack

> Enabling Secure, Open, and European-Controlled Cybersecurity Infrastructure  
> Powered by **ZeroTrustBSD**, OpenBSD, and EU-based Open Source Technologies  

## 🎯 Objective

Establish a fully sovereign, **military-grade cybersecurity stack** than can be deployable across Europe or the globe for:
- National & local government IT
- Ministries and EU agencies
- Critical infrastructure & public utilities
- Defense and NATO-aligned networks
- Sovereign cloud and telecom edge

By anchoring the solution on **ZeroTrustBSD** and **OpenBSD**, this architecture guarantees:
- EU-based development & hosting
- Full source code transparency
- Compliance with **GDPR**, **NIS2**, and **DORA**
- Independence from foreign cloud or vendor ecosystems

## 🧠 Suggested Governance Model

Establish an **Open EuroTrust Foundation** to oversee development, standards, and lifecycle of the ZeroTrustBSD ecosystem:

- 🎓 **University partners**: academic research and talent pipeline  
- 🛠 **Industry integrators**: telecom, cloud, public sector IT firms  
- 🏛 **Government stakeholders**: cyber agencies (ANSSI, BSI, GovCERTs)

Funding: mix of **EU grants**, **public-private partnerships**, and **service revenue**
