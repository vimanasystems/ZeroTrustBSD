# 🛡️ ZeroTrustBSD: The Sovereign Cyber Defense OS  
> _"You don’t buy sovereignty. You build it — with **ZeroTrustBSD**."_

## 🌍 A New Era of Digital Sovereignty

In an age of quantum threats, cyber warfare, and vendor lock-in, **ZeroTrustBSD** emerges as a sovereign, open-source fortress — built not for convenience, but for survival.

This is not another firewall distro.  
It is an **Autonomous Cyber Defense Operating System** — engineered for:
- **National governments**
- **Central banks**
- **OT/ICS/SCADA systems**
- **Tactical edge deployments**
- **Critical infrastructure under NIS2, DORA, and LPM**

Born from real-world battles — securing the **Central Bank of Sint Maarten**, **SWIFT networks at BNP Paribas**, and **industrial systems under ANSSI compliance** — this is **battle-tested expertise**, open-sourced for the world.

Built on **OpenBSD**, hardened by `pledge(2)`, `unveil(2)`, and W^X, ZeroTrustBSD enforces **Zero Trust by design**, **microsegmentation by default**, and **regulatory compliance by automation**.

It is not just secure.  
It is **uncompromising**.

## ⚔️ Why ZeroTrustBSD Exists

Because sovereignty cannot be outsourced.

Because a bank in Luxembourg, a grid in the Caribbean, or a command post in a war zone should not depend on a vendor’s promise.

Because when the quantum storm hits, we must already be secure.

Because too many “secure” systems are built on bloated Linux kernels, opaque binaries, and backdoored firmware.

ZeroTrustBSD exists because:
- **RSA-2048 will fall to quantum computers by 2030**
- **Legacy firewalls cannot enforce true Zero Trust**
- **NIS2 and DORA demand real compliance — not checkbox exercises**
- **Satellite internet (Starlink), private 5G (srsRAN), and tactical mobility require sovereign stacks**

And because one man — **Uday Moorjani** — decided to build the future, not wait for it.

## 🧱 Core Principles

ZeroTrustBSD is built on five unbreakable pillars:

### 1. **Sovereignty First**
No cloud dependency. No vendor lock-in. No opaque binaries.  
Only open-source, auditable, reproducible code — because **your security cannot be controlled by a third party**.

### 2. **Zero Trust by Design**
No implicit trust. No flat networks.  
Every service runs in **jails, VMs, or VXLANs**, with **identity-based access control** enforced by `pf.conf` anchors.

### 3. **Post-Quantum Ready**
Integrated with **OQS-OpenSSL** (Kyber, Dilithium) — because **PQC migration starts now**, not when NIST finalizes standards.

### 4. **Regulatory Compliance Built-In**
Automated controls for:
- **NIS2** (Article 21, risk management)
- **DORA** (ICT risk, incident reporting)
- **ISO 27001** (A.13, A.14)
- **LPM** (French military-grade segmentation)

No more audit panic.  
Compliance is code.

### 5. **Tactical Resilience**
Runs on:
- **Starlink** (SATCOM)
- **srsRAN** (private 4G/5G)
- **Raspberry Pi** (edge)
- **NUC** (data center)

Deployable in **embassies, disaster zones, or air-gapped bunkers** — with or without internet.

## 🔮 The Future Is Autonomous

ZeroTrustBSD is not just a firewall.  
It is an **Autonomous Cyber Defense OS** — capable of:
- Self-securing in hostile environments
- Enforcing policy without human intervention
- Detecting threats with Wazuh, Suricata, Zeek
- Generating AI-powered incident reports

It unifies:
- **Firewall**
- **Router**
- **SIEM**
- **Compliance Engine**
- **Identity Manager**

All on a single, hardened OpenBSD base.

> This is not the future.  
> This is the **only way forward**.

> **Cybersecurity Architect | Former RSSI, Sint Maarten | SWIFT, NIS2, DORA, PQC Expert**

This is not theory.  
It is **battle-tested expertise** — from securing central banks to teaching Zero Trust at École Hexagone.

ZeroTrustBSD is the culmination of a career spent defending what matters.

Now, it’s open for the world. What's up Q?
