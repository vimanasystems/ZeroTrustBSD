# 📘 Introduction to ZeroTrustBSD

**ZeroTrustBSD** is a security-hardened, open-source firewall and operating system built upon **OpenBSD**, engineered to meet the needs of modern digital sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and resilient infrastructure in high-risk or mission-critical environments.

In a world of increasing cyber threats, geopolitical instability, and chip supply fragility, ZeroTrustBSD offers an open, auditable, and sovereign alternative to commercial firewall appliances, empowering governments, enterprises, and critical sectors to maintain full control over their security perimeter.

## 🌐 Why ZeroTrustBSD?

Traditional firewalls, often built on closed platforms and proprietary firmware, present systemic risk and lack transparency. ZeroTrustBSD redefines trust at the hardware and software level through:

- Open-source software only — BSD-licensed and verifiable
- Hardware-agnostic deployments — from data centers to tactical radios
- Secure-by-default posture — no hidden services, no trust assumptions

## 🧠 What Sets It Apart

| Area                     | Feature |
|--------------------------|---------|
| **Security Architecture**| Based on OpenBSD, with pf, VMM, relayd or HaProxy, unveil/pledge |
| **Identity & Access**    | Integrated with RCDevs OpenOTP, Azure AD, LDAP and FreeIPA|
| **Network Segmentation** | Microsegmentation with VXLAN, MPLS, and jails |
| **Observability**        | Native eBPF, Prometheus, YARA, Wazuh |
| **Compliance**           | Built-in compliance templates for GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001 |
| **Deployment Agility**   | Supports air-gapped USB install, cloud VMs, PXE boot |
| **Quantum Ready**        | Supports post-quantum encryption and QKD integration |
| **Centralized Control** | Web GUI for managing multiple firewall instances |

## 🚀 Designed For

ZeroTrustBSD serves as a trusted perimeter and internal segmentation solution for:

- **Government Agencies**
- **Defense & Tactical Environments**
- **Financial Services & FinTech**
- **Industrial Systems (OT, SCADA)**
- **Telco & Satellite Edge Nodes**
- **Secure Cloud & On-Prem Deployments**

---

## 📦 Build Philosophy

- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only essential services included by default
- **Isolation First**: VMM and jails isolate tenants, users, and risk zones
- **Audit Friendly**: Logs are structured, exportable, and verifiable
- **Zero Trust Compliant**: Every user, device, and flow is authenticated
