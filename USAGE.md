# DynFi Manager on OpenBSD ‚Äì Usage Guide (ZeroTrustBSD Edition)

This guide outlines how to deploy and use **DynFi Manager** on **OpenBSD** as part of the **ZeroTrustBSD** framework by [Vimana Systems](https://github.com/vimanasystems/ZeroTrustBSD). It includes setup instructions, LDAP/AD integration, HA with CARP, microsegmentation using VXLAN, and Zero Trust enhancements.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- OpenBSD 7.x or later
- DynFi Manager installed
- PostgreSQL or MariaDB backend
- Optionally integrated with: LDAP/Active Directory, VXLAN, SIEMs
- ZeroTrustBSD configuration baseline

---

## üöÄ Starting DynFi Manager

```sh
rcctl enable dynfi
rcctl start dynfi
rcctl check dynfi
```

Access via browser:

```
https://your-server-ip:8443
```

---

## üîß Core Configuration

Config file: `/etc/dynfi/dynfi.conf`

```ini
[database]
type = postgresql
host = 127.0.0.1
name = dynfi
user = dynfi_user
password = your_secure_password

[web]
port = 8443
bind = 0.0.0.0

[ldap]
enabled = true
uri = ldaps://ldap.example.com
bind_dn = cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
bind_password = supersecure
base_dn = dc=example,dc=com
user_filter = (objectClass=posixAccount)
group_filter = (objectClass=posixGroup)

[logging]
level = INFO
```

---

## üñ• Web UI Access

Default login:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `dynfi`

Change immediately after first login.

---

## üë• LDAP / Active Directory Integration

DynFi integrates with LDAP/AD for authentication:

- Set in `dynfi.conf`
- Map LDAP groups to DynFi roles
- Test and validate from the web UI

Refer to ZeroTrustBSD‚Äôs `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for further SIEM or IAM integration.

---

## üì° High Availability with CARP

Set up CARP for floating IP-based failover:

```sh
ifconfig em0 vhid 1 pass sharedsecret carpdev em0 192.168.1.1/24
```

- Primary: `advskew 100`
- Secondary: `advskew 200`

Use real IPs in DynFi for node monitoring.

---

## üîÅ Configuration Sync (RCDEV)

Use `rcdev(4)` for config synchronization:

1. Configure primary node
2. Enable rcdevsync:
   ```sh
   rcctl enable rcdevsync
   ```

Trigger `rcdevsync` via DynFi deploy hooks to push updates across HA members.

---

## üåê VXLAN Microsegmentation

Based on `MICROSEGMENTATION.md`:

```sh
ifconfig vxlan0 create
ifconfig vxlan0 tunnel 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2
ifconfig vxlan0 vxlanid 1000
ifconfig vxlan0 192.168.100.1/24
```

- Define segments as DynFi "zones"
- Apply object-based firewall rules to enforce microsegmentation
- Tag VXLAN interfaces for visibility and audit

---

## üõ° Zero Trust & Sovereignty

In line with `SOVEREIGN-STRATEGY.md`:

- Enforce **role-based access controls**
- Maintain **data residency** (local DB/log storage)
- Use PF to **whitelist control-plane access**
- Integrate with centralized **logging and threat detection**

---

## üìÅ Logs & Backups

- Logs: `/var/log/dynfi.log`
- Backups: `/var/dynfi/backups/`

Rotate logs:

```sh
newsyslog
```

Backup DB:

```sh
pg_dump dynfi > backup.sql
```

---

## üìä External Integration

From `EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`:

- Forward logs to your SIEM
- Automate via DynFi‚Äôs REST API
- Integrate with provisioning and alerting systems

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| UI not responding | Check port/interface in `dynfi.conf` |
| LDAP errors | Verify bind credentials and filters |
| CARP failover not working | Adjust `advskew`, check shared secret |
| VXLAN not routing | Validate MTU and endpoint addresses |

---

## üîß Commands Summary

## üß© Multi-Tenancy with DynFi

DynFi can manage multiple tenants (clients or departments) securely:

- Create **separate administrative domains** within DynFi for each tenant
- Use **RBAC** to assign specific user roles per tenant
- Apply **tagging or zoning** to isolate tenant policies and firewall rules
- Leverage **VXLAN** or **VRFs** per tenant to ensure strict isolation

```
+-------------------+    +-------------------+
|  Tenant A Domain  |    |  Tenant B Domain  |
|  VXLAN ID 1000    |    |  VXLAN ID 2000    |
+---------+---------+    +---------+---------+
          |                          |
          v                          v
     Policy Group A            Policy Group B
```

---

## üö¶ MPLS Integration

While OpenBSD doesn‚Äôt natively support full MPLS stack, you can simulate label-switching via:

- **Encapsulation** via GRE/IPsec tunnels
- Central route control using DynFi
- Label-like routing by isolating services in **VXLAN or IPsec mesh**

Integrate DynFi with MPLS-capable infrastructure via **route injection** or **policy sync** using its API or firewall automation hooks.

---

## üì∂ SD-RAN (Software-Defined Radio Access Network)

For environments involving SD-RAN or edge radio units:

- Use **DynFi Manager** to push policies to firewall gateways near the RAN edge
- Create zones for **RAN**, **MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing)**, and **Core**
- Enforce **latency-sensitive policies** at the edge (real-time, prioritized traffic)
- DynFi REST API can integrate with RAN orchestration tools

```
+--------+   SD-RAN   +----------+
|  UE    | ---------> | RAN Edge |
+--------+            +----------+
                          |
                   +--------------+
                   | DynFi Policy |
                   +--------------+
```

---

## üåç BGP & Advanced Routing

DynFi can manage OpenBSD firewalls using BGP via `bgpd.conf`:

- Manage route advertisements per tenant or segment
- Dynamically adjust routes based on policy changes
- Integrate with external networks and upstream ISPs

### Example BGP Flow:

```
        +-------------+
        | DynFi Mgmt  |
        +------+------+
               |
     +---------+--------+
     |     OpenBSD FW    |
     |  with bgpd(8)     |
     +---------+--------+
               |
         +-----+-----+
         |  BGP Peer |
         +-----------+
```

To configure:

1. Add route maps and filters in `bgpd.conf`
2. Use DynFi deploy hooks to reload configuration
3. Monitor BGP sessions from the DynFi dashboard

---

## üõ† Tips for Advanced Networking

- Use `ospfd`, `bgpd`, `ripd` as needed with DynFi-managed devices
- Script advanced route management via `dynfi --hook <script>`
- Combine VXLAN + BGP for scalable east-west routing
- For SDN-like control, couple DynFi with orchestration (e.g., Ansible, NetBox)

- ‚úÖ **Auditable Change Management** ‚Äì All configuration changes and deployments are version-controlled and logged
- ‚úÖ **Data Sovereignty** ‚Äì All policies and logs remain within controlled infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Firewall Orchestration** ‚Äì Single-pane-of-glass control for global network enforcement

---

### üîí Compliance Mapping

| Control Area          | Compliance Frameworks                  | Coverage                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Access Controls       | ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, CIS             | LDAP, RBAC, 2FA            |
| Network Segmentation  | PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR                    | VXLAN, CARP, Policy Zones  |
| Logging & Monitoring  | SOC 2, NIS2, ISO 27001                  | Syslog, SIEM Integration   |
| High Availability     | NIST CSF, ITIL                          | CARP, RCDEV                |
| Data Residency        | GDPR, CCPA                              | Localized backups & logs   |

---

### üõ° Risk Mitigation Practices

- **Microsegmentation**: Limits blast radius of lateral movement
- **Policy Audits**: CISO can initiate policy diff reports between deployments
- **Configuration Drift Detection**: Alerting when deployed firewall config differs from source-of-truth in DynFi Manager
- **SIEM & SOAR Integration**: All security logs are forwardable to centralized analytics for proactive incident response

---

### üß© Recommended CISO Dashboards (Optional Dev Goals)

To support executive visibility:

- üîé Policy Drift / Deployment Status
- üìä Authentication Method Usage (MFA, LDAP, AD)
- üåê Active Segments (VXLAN zones, BGP peers)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Summary (Critical / Blocked / Audit mode)

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Executive Summary Template

A monthly report for CISO or Board:

```
ZeroTrustBSD: DynFi Network Enforcement Summary
------------------------------------------------
- Total Managed Firewalls: 12
- Policies Deployed: 145
- Segments Isolated: 5 (via VXLAN)
- Authenticated Users: 128 (LDAP & MFA)
- Detected Config Drifts: 2 (both resolved)
- Compliance Mapping: [ISO 27001 | PCI-DSS | NIST 800-53]
- No critical policy exceptions in this period.

Next Steps:
- Enable anomaly scoring in SIEM
- Expand SD-RAN zone coverage
```
