## üö® Legal Compliance Strategy

- **Core Sovereignty:** ZeroTrustBSD core remains BSD-licensed to preserve redistribution rights.
- **Optionality:** GPLv3/AGPLv3/Elastic components are modular and externally integrated to avoid contaminating the BSD codebase.
- **No Copyleft Propagation:** Core system functions (firewall, networking, crypto signing) do not inherit GPL/AGPL restrictions.
- **Open Licensing Transparency:** Every external package is properly referenced and documented in [LICENSE-ASSOCIATION.md](./LICENSE-ASSOCIATION.md).
- **End-user Choice:** Organizations deploying ZeroTrustBSD can selectively enable or disable GPL/AGPL/Elastic components according to their internal compliance policies.
