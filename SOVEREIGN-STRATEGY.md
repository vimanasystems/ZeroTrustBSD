# üõ°Ô∏è Sovereign Chip War Strategy ‚Äì ZeroTrustBSD

The escalating geopolitical tension around semiconductor technology‚Äîoften termed the "**Chip War**"‚Äîposes significant strategic risks for cybersecurity platforms like **ZeroTrustBSD**. To ensure sovereign operational autonomy and mitigate geopolitical risks, ZeroTrustBSD outlines the following strategic approach.

## üåê Overview and Strategic Context

Semiconductors are critical infrastructure components. Recent sanctions, tariffs, and export restrictions (notably by the U.S. and China) have revealed vulnerabilities in global chip supply chains, challenging national sovereignty and technology independence.

To maintain resilience and sovereignty, ZeroTrustBSD advocates:

- **Reducing foreign dependency**
- **Leveraging EU semiconductor initiatives**
- **Adopting open, sanction-resistant technologies**
- **Enhancing strategic stockpiles**
