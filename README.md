# 🛡️ ZeroTrustBSD Autonomous Cyber Defense OS

## The Sovereign Security Operating System. 

**Engineered for Nation-Scale Defense, Tactical Autonomy, and Critical Infrastructure Resilience.**

In an age where cyber threats evolve faster than our ability to defend, **ZeroTrustBSD** stands as a beacon of digital sovereignty and tactical resilience.
Built on hardened OpenBSD and engineered for defense, critical infrastructure, and regulated industry.

ZeroTrustBSD is a sovereign cybersecurity operating system delivering native Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) capabilities. Built upon OpenBSD, it integrates post-quantum encryption, policy automation, and military-grade networking to ensure security at every layer.

It is designed to meet the highest levels of regulatory and operational compliance across Europe and NATO-aligned organizations.

**ZeroTrustBSD** is more than just a firewall, it is a fully integrated, **Autonomous Cyber Defense OS**, built from the ground up on the rock-solid foundation of **OpenBSD**. 

This platform was designed for those who demand absolute control, security, and scalability in the most hostile environments.

Whether you’re securing the borders of a sovereign nation, protecting critical industrial infrastructure, or operating in the unforgiving fields of modern warfare, **ZeroTrustBSD** equips you with the tools to not just react, but **proactively defend**. 

The heart of its design is **Zero Trust**, enforcing strict **identity-based segmentation**, rigorous **compliance automation**, and state-of-the-art **microsegmentation** to ensure that no malicious actor ever moves laterally within your network.

Think of **ZeroTrustBSD** as your **first line of defense**, an open-source fortress that’s as tough as the mission it was designed for. Fully autonomous, highly secure, and adaptable, it scales from the **smallest edge deployment** to the most **complex, multi-tiered infrastructure**.

Get ready to step into the future of network security, where your firewall isn’t just an appliance, but the **central command layer** of a truly resilient, self-healing, and sovereign digital ecosystem.

> _Built on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/). Born for Zero Trust. Designed to be military grade, disaster recovery ready, resilient and nimble in many use cases._  
> “You don’t buy sovereignty. You build it — with ZeroTrustBSD.”

Here’s how **ZeroTrustBSD** with **FreeIPA** makes securing your digital ecosystem easy and effective:

- **Centralized Authentication**: Manage users and devices with ease using **FreeIPA’s** LDAP, ensuring a unified identity store for your entire organization. By integrating **ZeroTrustBSD**, you can control access across all your network devices with **granular security policies**.

- **Kerberos-Based Security**: **ZeroTrustBSD** benefits from **FreeIPA’s** **Kerberos** authentication to provide **high-assurance, single sign-on (SSO)** capabilities.

Secure authentication is ensured across all devices and services in your network, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: With **FreeIPA**’s MFA support, you can take security to the next level by enforcing **two-factor authentication** for every user. Whether it’s **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Password) or integrating **OpenOTP**, **ZeroTrustBSD** makes MFA easy and efficient.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Empower your security team with **FreeIPA’s** **RBAC**, which allows you to set strict access controls based on **user roles**. **ZeroTrustBSD** takes it further by enforcing these roles at the **network layer**, ensuring that each user’s access is in line with your security policies.

- **Host-Based Access Control**: FreeIPA’s host-based access control allows **ZeroTrustBSD** to enforce device-specific security policies, ensuring that only **trusted, compliant devices** are allowed to communicate within your secure network.

- **Audit Logging for Compliance**: Gain visibility into who is accessing what and when. With **FreeIPA’s** detailed **audit logging** integrated into **ZeroTrustBSD**, you can ensure full accountability and streamline compliance with regulations like **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, or **PCI-DSS**.

### 🔍 **Passive R-SPAN Monitoring**

# SPAN and RSPAN – A Non-Technical Overview

## 🕵️‍♂️ What Is SPAN and RSPAN?

### 🔍 Think of it like surveillance in a building:

You have a secure building with many rooms (your network). Each room represents a device or a user. Most of the time, what’s happening inside each room is hidden.

But what if you want to **monitor** what’s going on—without disturbing or exposing anything?

That’s what **SPAN** and **RSPAN** are for. They’re **digital security cameras** for your network.

---

## 📡 SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer)

- **What it does**: Makes a copy of all the digital traffic (like emails, files, apps) going in and out of a certain port (or “room”).
- **Where it sends it**: To a monitoring system like a cybersecurity tool (SIEM, IDS, etc.).

🧠 *Think of it as placing a camera right at the door of a room to watch who goes in or out—without blocking them.*

---

## 🌐 RSPAN (Remote SPAN)

- **What it does**: Same as SPAN—but it lets you watch traffic happening in another building (or another part of your network).
- **Where it sends it**: The copied traffic is sent **across the network** to a remote location for analysis.

🧠 *It’s like sending a live camera feed to a command center in another city.*

---

## 🤝 Why SPAN & RSPAN Matter

| Benefit                      | Explanation |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Incident Response**       | Security teams can “see” what happened during or after a breach. |
| **Compliance & Auditing**   | Regulators often require activity logging—SPAN helps create this trail. |
| **Threat Detection**        | SPAN lets AI or human analysts catch suspicious patterns in real time. |
| **Zero Trust Forensics**    | In systems like ZeroTrustBSD, SPAN helps prove policy enforcement is working. |

---

## 🔐 SPAN in ZeroTrustBSD

In the context of ZeroTrustBSD, **SPAN** is tightly integrated with **microsegmentation** and **threat detection**. Each “camera” is placed with precision—only watching what’s necessary, and always under cryptographic policy.

It’s not about surveillance. It’s about **resilience**, **evidence**, and **control**.
