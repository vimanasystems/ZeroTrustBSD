# 🛡️ ZeroTrustBSD – Autonomous Cyber Defense OS

### **The Sovereign Security Operating System. Engineered for Nation-Scale Defense, Tactical Autonomy, and Critical Infrastructure Resilience.**

In an age where cyber threats evolve faster than our ability to defend, **ZeroTrustBSD** stands as a beacon of digital sovereignty and tactical resilience. **ZeroTrustBSD** is more than just a firewall — it’s a fully integrated, **Autonomous Cyber Defense OS**, built from the ground up on the rock-solid foundation of **OpenBSD**. This platform was designed for those who demand absolute control, security, and scalability in the most hostile environments.

Whether you’re securing the borders of a sovereign nation, protecting critical industrial infrastructure, or operating in the unforgiving fields of modern warfare, **ZeroTrustBSD** equips you with the tools to not just react, but **proactively defend**. The heart of its design is **Zero Trust** — enforcing strict **identity-based segmentation**, rigorous **compliance automation**, and state-of-the-art **microsegmentation** to ensure that no malicious actor ever moves laterally within your network.

Think of **ZeroTrustBSD** as your **first line of defense** — an open-source fortress that’s as tough as the mission it was designed for. Fully autonomous, highly secure, and adaptable, it scales from the **smallest edge deployment** to the most **complex, multi-tiered infrastructure**.

Get ready to step into the future of network security, where your firewall isn’t just an appliance, but the **central command layer** of a truly resilient, self-healing, and sovereign digital ecosystem.

> _Built on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/). Born for Zero Trust. Designed to be military grade, disaster recovery ready, resilient and nimble in many use cases._  
> “You don’t buy sovereignty. You build it — with ZeroTrustBSD.”

## 🚀 Overview

**ZeroTrustBSD** is an **Autonomous Cyber Defense OS** — a digitally sovereign, open-source security platform built on OpenBSD. It transforms any appliance into a programmable network shield capable of:
- **Microsegmentation** with VXLAN, PF, and anchors
- **BGP-driven overlays** for interconnectivity and failover
- **Signed configuration enforcement** via [Signify](https://man.openbsd.org/signify)
- **Embedded compliance** automation for critical industries

Ideal for:
- Government & national defense networks
- Industrial and OT segmentation (IEC 62443, NIS2)
- Embassy, field, and disaster-resilient deployments
- Secure sovereign edge and cloud zones
