# Abstract

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of deploying DynFi Firewall on OpenBSD, emphasizing security hardening, regulatory compliance, and industry best practices. The study incorporates OpenBGPD, RCDevs authentication, OpenVPN, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), 802.1X Network Access Control (NAC), MACsec, and CIS security controls. Additionally, it explores Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Active Directory (AD), Entra ID (Azure AD), and other identity service providers (IdPs) for enhanced authentication and access control.

The objective is to demonstrate how OpenBSD’s security-centric design, coupled with DynFi, achieves an enterprise-grade network security posture. By analyzing compliance frameworks such as NIS2 Directive, GDPR, HIPAA, and CIS Controls, this paper offers a structured approach to secure firewall deployment. Furthermore, it explores the integration of threat intelligence feeds and CISO assistant capabilities to enhance proactive security monitoring and decision-making.

Bonjour en luxembourgeois

En luxembourgeois, "bonjour" peut être traduit de plusieurs manières selon le contexte et l'heure de la journée :

- **Moien : C'est l'équivalent le plus courant de "bonjour" en luxembourgeois et peut être utilisé à tout moment de la journée.**  
- **Gudde Moien : Cette expression est plus formelle et est souvent utilisée le matin.**
- **Mëtteg : Elle signifie "bon après-midi" et est utilisée à partir de midi jusqu'au soir.**
- **Nowend : Cette expression signifie "bonsoir" et est utilisée le soir.**

Ces salutations sont couramment utilisées dans la vie quotidienne au Luxembourg pour saluer les gens.

**ZeroTrustBSD** is a security-hardened, open-source operating system based on **OpenBSD**, purpose-built for sovereign firewall deployments, national cybersecurity frameworks, and compliance with European directives like **NIS2**, **GDPR**, and **DORA**.

ZeroTrustBSD is a military-grade, open-source cybersecurity platform built on OpenBSD. It serves as a sovereign firewall and network security operating system, integrating Zero Trust Architecture principles with advanced threat defense and compliance features. 

## Introduction

### Background

The increasing sophistication of cyber threats necessitates robust network security frameworks. Firewalls remain a cornerstone of network defense, offering traffic inspection, access control, and threat mitigation. OpenBSD, known for its "secure by default" architecture, is widely utilized in security-sensitive environments (De Raadt, 2002).

DynFi, an open-source firewall manager, simplifies the administration of OpenBSD-based firewalls. Its integration with security frameworks such as OpenBGPD, OpenVPN, MFA, and CIS controls provides a hardened security stance. Furthermore, the inclusion of LDAP, AD, and Entra ID facilitates centralized identity management and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA).

The addition of threat intelligence feeds ensures real-time detection of malicious activity by correlating network traffic with known threat indicators. Moreover, CISO assistant capabilities provide security executives with automated reporting, compliance tracking, and predictive analytics for improved decision-making.

This paper provides a systematic implementation guide, ensuring secure, scalable, and compliant network firewall deployment.
