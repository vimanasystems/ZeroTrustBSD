# ZeroTrustBSD Firewall 🔒
## Next-Generation Enterprise Firewall Proudly Developed in Luxembourg 🇱🇺

Bonjour en luxembourgeois

En luxembourgeois, "bonjour" peut être traduit de plusieurs manières selon le contexte et l'heure de la journée :

- **Moien : C'est l'équivalent le plus courant de "bonjour" en luxembourgeois et peut être utilisé à tout moment de la journée.**  
- **Gudde Moien : Cette expression est plus formelle et est souvent utilisée le matin.**
- **Mëtteg : Elle signifie "bon après-midi" et est utilisée à partir de midi jusqu'au soir.**
- **Nowend : Cette expression signifie "bonsoir" et est utilisée le soir.**

Ces salutations sont couramment utilisées dans la vie quotidienne au Luxembourg pour saluer les gens.
