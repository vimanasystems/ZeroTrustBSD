# 🛡️ ZeroTrustBSD  
## The Autonomous Cyber Defense OS  
> **Engineered for Nation-Scale Defense, Tactical Autonomy, and Critical Infrastructure Resilience**  
> _“You don’t buy sovereignty. You build it — with **ZeroTrustBSD**.”_

In an age where cyber threats evolve faster than patches are deployed, **ZeroTrustBSD** stands as a sovereign, open-source fortress — built on **OpenBSD**, hardened by **real-world war zones**, and designed for **those who defend what matters most**.

This is not a firewall.  
It is an **Autonomous Cyber Defense Operating System** — purpose-built for:
- 🏛️ **National governments**
- 💳 **Central banks & SWIFT networks**
- ⚙️ **OT/ICS/SCADA systems**
- 🛰 **Tactical edge & SATCOM deployments**
- 🌍 **Sovereign cloud & disaster recovery**

Born from the mind of **Uday Moorjani** — former RSSI of Sint Maarten, cybersecurity architect for BNP Paribas, Airbus, Orange Cyberdefense, and the Cour de Justice de l’UE — this is **battle-tested expertise**, open-sourced for the world.

Built on **OpenBSD**, hardened with `pledge(2)`, `unveil(2)`, W^X, and securelevel — because **trust is a vulnerability**.

> ZeroTrustBSD: Where **sovereignty**, **resilience**, and **open-source truth** converge.

For a full introduction, see [INTRODUCTION.md](INTRODUCTION.md).

## 🧩 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Zero Trust Microsegmentation** | Identity-aware, VXLAN-based, PF-anchored — no lateral movement |
| **Post-Quantum Ready** | Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+ — because RSA-2048 won’t survive 2030 |
| **CISO Assistant** | AI-driven compliance, audit prep, and “why is port 8443 blocked?” |
| **OpenCTI Integration** | Threat intel, not just alerts — knowledge is power |
| **SATCOM & SD-RAN** | Starlink + srsRAN = sovereign 5G in the middle of nowhere |
| **Regulatory Compliance Built-In** | NIS2, DORA, GDPR, PCI-DSS — automated, not guessed |
| **Military-Grade Encryption** | Not “military-grade” like a marketing brochure. Actual military-grade. |

---

## 🛡 FreeIPA: Because Identity Is Power
ZeroTrustBSD integrates **FreeIPA** — because you shouldn’t have to choose between security and sanity.

- **Centralized Auth** via LDAP
- **Kerberos SSO** — because passwords are for peasants
- **MFA Enforcement** — TOTP, OpenOTP, whatever you trust
- **RBAC** — because not everyone should access the nuclear codes
- **Host-Based Access Control** — only trusted devices get in
- **Audit Logging** — for when the auditors come knocking

👉 Think of it as **identity with teeth**.

---

## ☁️ Multi-Cloud & Private Cloud Integration
ZeroTrustBSD works where you work.

### **VMware NSX**
- Microsegmentation at scale
- Policy enforcement without vCenter tantrums

### **OpenStack**
- VXLAN via Neutron
- Keystone + MFA = secure identity

### **AWS / Azure / GCP**
- BGP-driven overlays
- Identity federation
- Observability with Prometheus + Grafana

It doesn’t matter if your cloud is private, public, or a dream in someone’s PowerPoint.  
ZeroTrustBSD secures it.

---

## 🛰️ Tactical Networking: Built for War, Not Meetings
- **VXLAN Overlays** — isolate like a surgeon
- **BGP Orchestration** — with `openbgpd`, because static routes are for dinosaurs
- **CARP** — high availability without needing a prayer
- **Purdue Model Isolation** — jails, loopbacks, anchored `pf.conf` — all enforced
- **R-SPAN Monitoring** — because you need to *see* the attack before it kills you

👉 See [`MICROSEGMENTATION.md`](MICROSEGMENTATION.md) for full playbooks — written by someone who’s done it in the field.

---

## 🛡 Threat Detection & Observability  
### (Because “We Were Hacked” Should Never Be Your First Alert)

- **Wazuh**: SIEM, FIM, log analysis — free, open, powerful
- **Suricata**: IDS/IPS with real threat feeds
- **Zeek**: Passive telemetry — see what *shouldn’t* be happening
- **OpenCTI**: Aggregate, correlate, and act on threat intel
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Full-stack visibility — no blind spots

All integrated. All open-source. All running on OpenBSD.

---

## 🔒 Next-Gen Cryptography: Preparing for the Quantum Storm
- **WireGuard** — modern, fast, secure
- **IPsec / OpenVPN** — because legacy still exists
- **PQC Integration** — Kyber (KEM), Dilithium (signatures)
- **Crypto-Agile Design** — ready for whatever NIST throws at us next

We’re not waiting for quantum computers to break RSA.  
We’re **already ahead**.

---

## 🖥 Remote Command Console (UI)  
### (Yes, There’s a Dashboard — But It’s Not Pretty)

- React + Grafana
- Real-time firewall status, VXLAN topology, threat events
- Actions: Lockdown, reload, BGP reset
- Lightweight, air-gapped, and deployable on a Raspberry Pi

Because in a crisis, you don’t need a GUI.  
You need **control**.

---

## 🔐 Access Control Models (OpenBSD-Aware)

| Model | OpenBSD Support |
|------|-----------------|
| **MAC (Securelevel, Pledge, Unveil)** | Native — the OS is its own bouncer |
| **ABAC (LDAP + PF + Certs)** | Supported — attribute-based, not guess-based |
| **PBAC (Policy-Based via pf.conf)** | Native — your firewall rules are law |
| **Certificate/Key-Based ACLs** | Fully Supported — no passwords, just trust |
| **Capability-Based IPC (pledge/capsicum)** | Supported — because even processes need limits |

> OpenBSD believes in **deterministic, auditable, minimal-privilege** access.  
> No magic. No mystery. Just control.

## 🔐 QKD vs PQC: The Quantum Truth

| Feature | QKD | PQC |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Based on Physics | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Needs Special Hardware | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Internet-Scalable | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Immune to Quantum | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Detects Eavesdropping | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Used in TLS | ❌ Not yet | ✅ Kyber/Dilithium (trials) |

> **Hybrid approach**: QKD for high-assurance key exchange, PQC for global infrastructure.

## 🧠 AI Integration: Because Even Geniuses Need Help

ZeroTrustBSD uses **open, auditable AI models** — no cloud, no PII leakage.

### Use Cases:
- **CISO Assistant**: “Is this rule compliant with NIS2?”
- **SIEM Triage**: “Is this alert worth waking me up for?”
- **Config Review**: “Why is port 8443 open?”
- **Incident Narrator**: Auto-generate postmortems

Example:
```bash
$ ask-zero "Why is this IP blocked?"
🤖: Check `pf.conf` anchor `threat_feeds`. Matched on C2 server in Ukraine.
