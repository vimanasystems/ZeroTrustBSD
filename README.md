# 🛡️ ZeroTrustBSD – Autonomous Cyber Defense OS

### **The Sovereign Security Operating System. Engineered for Nation-Scale Defense, Tactical Autonomy, and Critical Infrastructure Resilience.**

In an age where cyber threats evolve faster than our ability to defend, **ZeroTrustBSD** stands as a beacon of digital sovereignty and tactical resilience. **ZeroTrustBSD** is more than just a firewall — it’s a fully integrated, **Autonomous Cyber Defense OS**, built from the ground up on the rock-solid foundation of **OpenBSD**. This platform was designed for those who demand absolute control, security, and scalability in the most hostile environments.

Whether you’re securing the borders of a sovereign nation, protecting critical industrial infrastructure, or operating in the unforgiving fields of modern warfare, **ZeroTrustBSD** equips you with the tools to not just react, but **proactively defend**. The heart of its design is **Zero Trust** — enforcing strict **identity-based segmentation**, rigorous **compliance automation**, and state-of-the-art **microsegmentation** to ensure that no malicious actor ever moves laterally within your network.

Think of **ZeroTrustBSD** as your **first line of defense** — an open-source fortress that’s as tough as the mission it was designed for. Fully autonomous, highly secure, and adaptable, it scales from the **smallest edge deployment** to the most **complex, multi-tiered infrastructure**.

Get ready to step into the future of network security, where your firewall isn’t just an appliance, but the **central command layer** of a truly resilient, self-healing, and sovereign digital ecosystem.

**ZeroTrustBSD** is a next-generation, military-grade firewall and network security platform based on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org), designed for sovereign cloud deployments, national cybersecurity operations, operational technology (OT), industrial control systems (ICS), and enterprise-grade multi-tenancy. It is fully BSD-licensed and optimized for mission assurance, cyber defense, and regulatory compliance across telecom, government, energy, manufacturing, and finance sectors.

## 📦 Quick Start

```sh
doas sh install.sh
```

- Review `/etc/pf.conf` and adjust anchors per tenant
- Configure VMs using `/etc/vm.conf` and `vmctl`
- Enable DynFi agent and RCDevs auth as needed
- Isolate SCADA/PLC network in L1-L3 per Purdue segmentation
- Logs and metrics forwarded via Filebeat/Prometheus
