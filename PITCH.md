# 🚀 ZeroTrustBSD – Global Strategy Pitch

> A sovereign, modular, and post-quantum operating system – built for digital autonomy, cyber resilience, and multi-regulatory compliance.

> A modern, modular, and military-grade firewall operating system — built for digital sovereignty, resilience, and compliance.

## 🛡 What is ZeroTrustBSD?

**ZeroTrustBSD** is a BSD-licensed, audit-ready operating system based on OpenBSD. Designed from the kernel up with zero trust, post-quantum encryption, and identity-centric segmentation, it is engineered to secure critical infrastructure, defense networks, and regulated enterprises against evolving cyber and geopolitical threats.

---

## 🌐 Why Now – The Global Moment

- **Cyber attacks on sovereign infrastructure** are intensifying.
- **Digital sovereignty** is now core to national defense strategy.
- **Quantum computing** risks render classical encryption obsolete.
- **Regulatory convergence (NIS2, GDPR, DORA, ISO27001)** demands automated enforcement and evidence.

**ZeroTrustBSD is the answer** – transparent, programmable, interoperable, and reproducible.

## 🧭 Strategic Narrative

ZeroTrustBSD positions itself as the **“Digital Non-Alignment Stack”** — trusted by nations seeking autonomy, by industries seeking resilience, and by infrastructures that cannot afford compromise.

It is more than a firewall. It is the sovereign OS for tomorrow’s digital battlefield.

---

## 🔧 Technical Foundation

- Hardened OpenBSD Kernel (W^X, pledge, unveil, pf, VMM)
- FreeIPA for identity governance (IAM, PKI, RBAC)
- OpenCTI + Cortex + TheHive for threat mapping
- eBPF-based observability with YARA and journald sync
- VXLAN/MPLS/SD-RAN overlays for east-west segmentation
- RISC-V and ARM64 compatible, edge-ready

## 🌍 The Global Need

### Why Now?

- **Cyber warfare and infrastructure attacks** are accelerating.
- **Proprietary firewall vendors** are opaque, costly, and prone to backdoors.
- **Digital sovereignty** is a rising priority for nations, industries, and regulators.
- **Quantum computing** is threatening conventional encryption models.

**ZeroTrustBSD is the answer** — open, transparent, sovereign, and future-proof.
