# 🚀 Vision & Value of ZeroTrustBSD

> A modern, modular, and military-grade firewall operating system — built for digital sovereignty, resilience, and compliance.

---

## 🔐 What is ZeroTrustBSD?

**ZeroTrustBSD** is a hardened, BSD-licensed operating system and firewall platform based on OpenBSD. It is engineered to serve as a sovereign alternative to proprietary firewalls, designed for governments, critical infrastructure, military, and high-compliance enterprises.

---

## 🌍 The Global Need

### Why Now?

- **Cyber warfare and infrastructure attacks** are accelerating.
- **Proprietary firewall vendors** are opaque, costly, and prone to backdoors.
- **Digital sovereignty** is a rising priority for nations, industries, and regulators.
- **Quantum computing** is threatening conventional encryption models.

**ZeroTrustBSD is the answer** — open, transparent, sovereign, and future-proof.
